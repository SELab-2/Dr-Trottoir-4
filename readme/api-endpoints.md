# API endpoints

This is a temporary document that will be changed according to future needs.
For now, it can be used by both the backend team and the frontend team as a clear overview on how the API will look
like.
In the future, it might be useful to automatically generate API documentation.

#### Used HTTP response status codes

_Succesful_

* GET: 200 OK
* POST/DELETE: 204 No Content
* PATCH: 201 Created

_Unsuccessful_

An internal server error (500) after a request should never happen.

## /user

### Get

* `/{id}`

> Gets all data about user with given id

* `/all`

> Get a list of URL's to all users in the database

TODO: perhaps it would be more wise to define `all_students`, `all_superstudents` ... According to the authorization
rights of the logged in user, the user might fetch `all_students`, but not `all_superstudents`  
However, we can also change the view depending on the authorization level of the requester

### Post

TODO: figure out how this will work with auth.  
I am guessing an admin needs to create an account for a superstudent, a superstudent or admin for a student ...

Perhaps we could do something like this:  
Everyone can make a user account, but won't be able to do much (except perhaps fill in more info, see the welcome
page, ... ). Then a superstudent/admin could give the right permissions / role to that user  
*To be continued ...*

| Parameter    | 
|--------------|
| email        | 
| first_name   |
| last_name    | 
| password     | 
| phone_number | 
| region       | 
| role         | 

After a post, the server could respond with the link to the newly created resource.

TODO: figure out how to change email, maybe this will be clear if we implement a password forgot feature.

TODO: Is last URL necessary? No, but implementing this might speed up the app if there is a lot of
data to be fetched. If the frontend people would require more such detailed endpoints, it is easy for us to implement
them

patch
